# Knowledge Drop — Frontend env
#
# VITE_API_BASE is read at build and dev time by Vite and used by src/lib/api.js
# to construct API URLs.
#
# Local development:
#   - You can either leave VITE_API_BASE *unset* (in which case the app falls back
#     to http://127.0.0.1:8000), or set it explicitly to your backend URL.
#
#     Vite dev server:  http://localhost:5173
#     FastAPI backend:  http://localhost:8000
#
#   - The simplest local setup is:
#       backend on :8000
#       frontend on :5173
#       VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
#
# Render / production:
#   - The static site is served from its own host (e.g. https://logger-ui-…onrender.com)
#     and proxies API calls to the backend using a `/api/*` rewrite rule.
#   - In that setup, set VITE_API_BASE to an empty string so the frontend uses
#     same-origin `/api/...` URLs:
#
#       VITE_API_BASE=
#
#   - Render then rewrites `/api/*` to your backend service.
#
# This file documents the *dev* defaults; override these via Render’s environment
# settings for production.
